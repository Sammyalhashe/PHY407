#IMPORT modules division, everything from math, pyplot, and numpy, and scipy 

#OBTAIN number of particles from user

#GET a randomly generated number from -1.0 to 1.0 (Range for the height)

#COMPUTE the scattering angle (theta) using the values of height(z) generated above 
#and the formula in part a using a map

#DEFINE the theta array using the values of theta computed above

#COMPUTE the mean and standard deviation of the theta array using scipy

#PLOT the histogram with bin = 100 with the gaussian curve fit for comparison

#PARSE through the array for theta and count values which lie between 170*pi/180
#and 190*pi/180 radians

#PARSE through the array for theta and count values which lie between 90*pi/180
#and 110*pi/180 radians

#CALCULATE the ratio between the length of the two counts and the number of particles
#to give the relative probabilitys
